The following is a hint to the password to decode the gtc-keys.dmg file.  Its historical accuracy is questionable.

I first saw a Tesla in 2010.

But before it could be made, personal computers had to deceminate through the population and Musk, Theil, & Levchin all had to loop in together.

And long before that, Tesla had to win his fight with Thomas Edison over AC vs DC so he could become such an inspiration.
