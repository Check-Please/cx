		<h1>Checkout Express FAQ</h1>

		<p>Checkout Express is an app which lets your customers quickly checkout on their phone, instead of having to ask for the check.  The app works completely without involvement from the waitstaff, allowing you to offer fast, quality service even when your restaurant is overwhelmed.</p>
		<p>Currently we are looking for a restaurant like yours to try Checkout Express at.  The purpose of this trial period would be to simply get the app out in front of people and see if it is something they appreciate.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h2><strong>Q:</strong> How does the app work?</h2>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> At the end of a customer's meal, the customer opens up the app.  The app then automatically figures out where the customer is sitting, what has been ordered at that table, and lets the customer pay.  The payment is processed through your POS, so you do not have to worry about any extra paperwork or bookkeeping.  Once the payment is processed, the corresponding ticket on the POS is closed, and the customer can leave.  The whole process can happen in a matter of seconds.</p>
				<p>Customers do not have to use this app to checkout if they do not want to.  The app is only an alternative to the normal checkout process for busy customers.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2><strong>Q:</strong> What's in it for us (the restaurant)?</h2>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> The app can save your customers' time, help you turn tables faster, and lessen the load on your waitstaff.  Additionally, if you let us do this trial at your restaurant, and the trial shows that the app is an idea worth pursuing, we will offer you the app for free for life.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2><strong>Q:</strong> What would the trial look like?</h2>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> We would come in and attach a bluetooth chip to the underside of three of your tables.  Then, at some low traffic point in time (e.g. tuesday evening between lunch and dinner) we would enable the app at three select tables.  No setup work would be required on your part.</p>
				<p>We are still working on POS integration, so for the time being Sammy Jelin (one of our co-founders) would manually simulate the integration.  He would be physically present inside the restaurant, and would copy all orders made at app-enabled tables into our database.  When a customer paid with the app, Sammy would manually enter their card information into your POS in order to charge the customer's credit card.  When the payment was complete, Sammy would close the corresponding ticket in the POS.</p>
				<p>This "manual integration" would behave like real POS integration.  It would consume Sammy's time, but no one else's.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2><strong>Q:</strong> Why haven't you got real POS integration?</h2>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> POS integration is a long (several month) and expensive ($15K+) process.  Before we make that kind of commitment, we would like to get the product in front of customers and see how they would react to it.  So for now, manual integration makes the most sense.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2><strong>Q:</strong> Would this be secure?</h2>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes.  When a customer made a payment, the card information would be sent over an encrypted network to Sammy's computer.  The payment information would never be stored on Sammy's hard drive, and would only be temporarily displayed on his computer screen.  The card would then be processed through your POS, leveraging the security built into your normal card charging system.  Once the payment was made, the information would be cleared from Sammy's screen, after which he would have no record of the payment information.</p>
				<p>Because the card information would be encrypted before transmission, would not stored on disk, would be processed through your POS, and would be quickly cleared from the screen, the process would be in compliance with all security standards which we are aware of, including PCI-DSS.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2><strong>Q:</strong> What if something goes wrong?</h2>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> The app has been thoroughly tested for bugs, so it is very unlikely that something would go wrong.  In the unlikely event that there was a problem, Sammy would immediately disable the app, and we would cover paying for any transactions which were lost because of the error.  While the app was disabled, customers would have to checkout through the waitstaff as though the app didn't exist.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2><strong>Q:</strong> What would happen to the receipts?</h2>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> During the trial period, the receipts would be printed at the POS like normal, and Sammy would bring them to the table for the customer to sign.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2><strong>Q:</strong> When could this trial happen?</h2>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> Currently the Checkout Express app is pending approval at the Apple Appstore.  It will likely be approved soon.  When that happens, we can begin the trial.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2><strong>Q:</strong> How much will this cost once the trial period is over?</h2>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> If you let us run this trial at your restaurant, we will let you have the app for free at that location for life.  The price we will charge other locations is to be determined, but will likely be around $2/table/month.</p>
