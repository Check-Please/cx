		<h1>Checkout Express FAQ</h1>

		<p>Checkout Express is an app which lets customers who are in a hurry checkout on their phone, instead of having to get the check from the waitstaff.  Currently we are looking for a restaurant like yours to test Checkout Express at.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<h2><strong>Q:</strong> What would the testing look like?</h2>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> We would come in and attach a bluetooth chip to the underside of three of your tables.  We would also borrow a complete menu, including item modifiers, for a couple hours. Then, at some low traffic point in time (e.g. tuesday evening between lunch and dinner) we would enable the app at select tables.  No setup work would be required on your part.</p>
				<p>While the app was enabled, Martin Jelin (one of our co-founders) would be in the restaurant, and would record all orders made at app-enabled tables into our database.  When a customer paid with the app, Martin would manually enter their information into your POS in order to charge the customer's credit card.  The result would be that no extra work would be required by your waitstaff, and that the customer's payment would show up in your POS like any other credit card payment which was manually entered (as opposed to swiped).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2><strong>Q:</strong> Why would Martin be manually entering in the orders/payments?</h2>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> POS integration is a long (several month) and expensive ($15K+) process.  Before we make that kind of commitment, we would like to get the product in front of customers to see how they would react.  So for now, Martin would manually simulate the integration by being physically inside the restaurant.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2><strong>Q:</strong> Would this be secure?</h2>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes.  When a customer made a payment, the card information would be sent over an encrypted network to Martin's computer.  The payment information would never be stored on Martin's hard drive, and would only be temporarily displayed on his computer screen.  After the payment was made, the information would be cleared from Martin's screen, after which he would have no record of the payment information.</p>
				<p>Because the card information would be encrypted before transmission, would not stored on disk, and would be quickly cleared from the screen, the process would be in compliance with all security standards which we are aware of, including PCI-DSS.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2><strong>Q:</strong> What if something goes wrong?</h2>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> If something went wrong, Martin would immediately disable the app.  We would cover paying for any transactions which were lost because of the error.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2><strong>Q:</strong> What's in it for us?</h2>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> The app can save your customer's time, help you turn tables faster, and lessen the load on your waitstaff.  Additionally, if you help us during this testing period, and the testing shows that the app is an idea worth pursuing, we would be willing to offer you the app for free for a year.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2><strong>Q:</strong> When could this testing happen?</h2>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> Currently the Checkout Express app is pending approval at the Apple Appstore.  It will likely be approved soon.  When that happens, we can test it out.</p>
