				<h1>tl;dr <span>We got the equivalent of around 50 uses per location per week</span></h1>

				<h1>Setup</h1>
				<p>I ran the experiment at a restaurant called <a href="http://www.bakerysocial.com">Social at Bakery Square</a>.  Bakery Square is essentially a small outdoor mall with some office buildings.  It is home to both Google's Pittsburgh offices and <a href="http://www.techshop.ws/pittsburgh.html">TechShop Pittsburgh</a>.  I picked the location because I believed that there would be a higher concentration of early adopters in that area than most other areas of Pittsburgh.  Since my goal was to get as much user feedback as possible, and since I would have no existing user base to lean on, I wanted to do everything possible to make the conditions favorable.</p>
				<p>The core goal of this experiment was to determine if this was an idea worth pursuing.  In order to save time, I had not yet written Point of Sale (POS) System integration for the app.  Instead, during the experiment, I manually copied information back and forth from the POS' database into my own behind the scenes.  The app also badly needed a redesign, as I had made it before I really understood much about UI design.</p>
				<p>The exact setup of the experiment changed as I got user feedback, so I will describe the initial setup here and the changes as they occurred in the later parts.  The app was live at six of Social's 30+ tables.  However, I selected the six I believed would be most busy.</p>
				<p>On the tables where the app was live, I put a business card advertising the app.  The cards looked as follows:
					<img src="../img/info/experiment/card-v1.png" />
				The cards were placed in stands (seen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rolodex-Black-Business-Holder-22251/dp/B00006IAKZ">here</a>), 10 cards in each stand, one stand per table.</p>

				<h1>Days 1-3</h1>
				<h4>Saturday, March 29th, 2 PM - 4 PM</h4>
				<p>Only two groups actually sat at tables where the app was active during this period.  This was because people eat so slowly during brunch, this was such a short test at an awkward time, and I was only testing the app at 6 tables.  One of those was a group of elderly ladies.  The other was a group of three 20-somethings.  Neither group used the app. When the group of 20-somethings left I asked if they had seen the cards.  They said they had, they just didn't use the app anyway.</p>
				<h4>Tuesday, April 1st, 11:00 AM - 1:30 PM</h4>
				<p>Four groups had the chance to use the app, none of whom did.  I overheard one person at one table talking about the app, so when he left I asked him about it.  He said he was interested but didn't want to download a new app when he wasn't at home.</p>
				<p>Based on my interactions up to this point, I decided two things: (1) There needed to be a webapp version available for people to try the app (2) The tagline "In a rush?" isn't very good because most people aren't in a rush.  So I redesigned the cards like so:
					<img src="../img/info/experiment/card-v2-hybrid.png" />
				I filled in the blank space at the end of the URL with a pen.  I also made a webapp-only version of the card:
					<img src="../img/info/experiment/card-v2-web.png" />
				</p>
				<h4>Wednesday, April 2nd, 5:00 PM - Midnight</h4>
				<p>This time I did the experiment at 8 tables: 6 had the hybrid cards, and 2 had the web-only cards.</p>
				<p>When I first entered, I was informed that around 4 PM the man from the day before who was interested came back, said he downloaded the app, and wanted to try it.  I was not around to run everything at that point in time however, so he couldn't actually do it.</p>
				<p>While I was there, 11 groups got a chance to use the app.  Of those, only one group, at the very end of service, actually used the app.  The person who used it was himself an entrepreneur, and he used the native version (as opposed to the web app).</p>
				<h4>Thursday, April 2nd</h4>
				<p>I had a doctor's appointment, and had to spend some time thinking about how to bring up my metrics.  So I did not test the app on this day.  However, I did redesign the card, which now looks as follows:
					<img src="../img/info/experiment/card-v3.png" />
				At the end of the URL, I wrote in a number which identified the table.  As you can see, it is a web only design.  I decided that to keep the design simple, I couldn't include both web and native instructions.  I decided the webapp was more important for first use, and I could get native users when I emailed someone their receipt.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span class="anchor" id="day4"></span>
				<h1>Day 4 <span>(Friday, April 4th, 11:30 AM - 9:30 PM)</span></h1>
				<p>No one used the app from 11:30 AM to 5:00 PM, at which I decided I need to spend more time thinking about how to improve the metrics.  I disabled the app and went home.  I still left the business cards on the table though.  This way, I would know if someone visited the webapp URL, even though that person would just get an error message.  At 8 PM, I saw that two people attempted to use the app.  I found the result encouraging, and left the cards on the tables until 9:30 PM.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span class="anchor" id="day5"></span>
				<h1>Day 5 <span>(Saturday, April 5th, 6 PM - 8:40 PM)</span></h1>
				<p>I realized at this point that the app itself wasn't actually important to the experiment.  What I was interested in was if I could get someone to <i>try</i> to use the app, not if anyone actually used it.  Since logging everything behind the scenes was such a pain, I decided I would disable the app, switch it to just send me a notification, and manually handle the bill for any customers who tried to use the app.  In other words, I would be acting as a waiter specifically there to handle the bill of anyone who tried to use the app.  Transferring data for eight tables was unreliable anyway.</p>
				<p>4 people tried to use the app.  Oddly though, they all tried to use it shortly after they ordered, not at the end of their meal when they were checking out.  When I came over to their table, I said that I would be happy to check them out if they reloaded the app at the end of their meal, and asked why they had tried to use it so soon in the first place.  They said they were just curious.  One person mentioned that he had had this problem in the past so he was particularly interested in a solution.</p>
				<p>Most people were pretty angry to learn that the app didn't really work.  They were curious more than anything else, and if it wasn't a "real" app they didn't really care.  I ended the experiment early because I didn't want the restaurant to receive any complaints.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span class="anchor" id="conclusion"></span>
				<h1>Conclusion</h1>
				<p>In the end, 8 people tried to use the app, and one person actually used it.  Presumably all 8 of those people would have actually used it if it were functioning the whole time.  Conservatively, that means we can extrapolate to 50 new people using the app in any given week at each location.  If you look at the <a href="metrics.html">competing metrics</a>, these usage numbers are nearly 2 orders of magnitude above everyone else.  Of course, extrapolation like this is problematic, but I think these result are very encouraging.</p>
				<p>Another major thing I learned is that people are mostly just curious, and the app needs to work with their curiosity.  When I am manually passing information from the restaurant's POS system into my database, it takes about five minutes for the information to enter my database (on average), so in this state the app wouldn't work for someone who tried to open it up directly after they ordered.  What's more, until I finish real integration, the payment process still ends with me physically handing a check to the diners.  This totally violates the feeling of the app being automatic.  As such, before I try to develope an actual user base, I'm going to need to finish real POS integration.  A redesign was also in order, though I have since finished that.</p>
