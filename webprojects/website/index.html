			<h2>Checkout Express lets you pay your bill without having to get the bill from the waitstaff</h2>
			<p>Simply open up the Checkout Express app and pay.  Checkout Express can automatically figure out where you're sitting and look up your order, so there's no need to inform the waitstaff ahead of time or set up any sort of account.  Everything is handled for you.</p>
			<h1 id="how">How it works</h1>
			<p>Checkout Express uses Bluetooth technology to automatically identify where you're sitting, and integrates with the restaurant's Point of Sale software to look up your order and let you pay.  Credit card information is encrypted and stored on your phone, so there's no need to register any sort of account.</p>
			<h1 id="demo">Online Demo</h1>
			<p>You can see a demo of how the app works <a href="../?IKA">here</a>.  Please keep in mind that the app was designed for a smartphone, so you will probably get a better idea of what the app is like if you resize your browser window to be narrow and tall.  Otherwise the app will assume you are in landscape mode and make the text very large.  The online version of the app requires a password in order to safely store credit card information, but the native app will not.  If you do not want to use your credit card number we recommend the fake credit card number "4444333322221111".</p>
			<h1 id="about">Who we are</h1>
			<p>Currently it's just me, Martin Samuel Jelin.  I graduated as a CS/Math double major from Carnegie Mellon University in may of 2013.  You can email me about anything at <a href="mailto:sjelin@chkex.com">sjelin@chkex.com</a></p>
			<h1 id="apply">Apply</h1>
			<p>I'd love for someone else to join the team!  Full time would be best, but we can talk even if you're only interest in part time or an internship.  Currently most of the work is programing, so you'd need to be able to do that.  There are also some topics which I feel my skills are insufficient in.  Specifically:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Design (have you seen how ugly this website is?)</li>
				<li>Servers/Database</li>
				<li>Hardware</li>
				<li>Machine Learning</li>
			</ul>
			<p>None of these skills are required, they're just topics which it would be nice for someone to understand.  I would try to make some statement about how awesome our culture is, but really it's just me.  If you were to join, you'd be half the team, and in that sense you'd have tremendous influence over what our culture would develop into.</p>
			<p>If you're interested, email <a href="mailto:sjelin@chkex.com">sjelin@chkex.com</a>.</p>
