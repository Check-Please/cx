			<h2>Checkout Express lets you pay your bill without having to get the check from the waitstaff</h2>
			<p>Simply open up the app and pay.  Checkout Express can automatically figure out where you're sitting and look up your order, so there's no need to inform the waitstaff ahead of time or set up any sort of account.  Everything is handled for you.</p>
			<h1 id="how">How it works</h1>
			<p>Checkout Express uses Bluetooth technology to automatically identify where you're sitting, and integrates with the restaurant's Point of Sale software to look up your order and let you pay.  Credit card information is encrypted and stored on your phone, so there's no need to register any sort of account.</p>
			<h1 id="demo">Online Demo</h1>
			<p>You can see a demo of how the app works <a href="../?IKA">here</a>.  Please keep in mind that the app was designed for a smartphone, so you will probably get a better idea of what the app is like if you resize your browser window to be narrow and tall.  Otherwise the app will assume you are in landscape mode and make the text very large.  The online version of the app requires a password in order to safely store credit card information, but the native app will not.  If you do not want to use your credit card number we recommend the fake credit card number "4444333322221111".</p>
