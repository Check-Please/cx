The following files are libraries which we wrote for internal use:

*	`async.js` - Some utilities for runing code which uses callbacks 
*	`functional.js` - Some utilities for writing functional code
*	`ajax.js` - A utility for simplifying ajax calls.  Coordinates with the
	code for parsing objects server side
*	`misc.js` - Random ultilities

Additionally, we include some files which help us be compatible with older
web browsers:

*	`compatibility.js` - Some functions which may not be defined in old
	browsers
*	`json2.js` - The JSON object, in case it isn't defined (for old browsers)
