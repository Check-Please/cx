<p>That said, it’s <strong>very</strong> unlikely that anyone could decrypt your credit card information without your password.  So as long as you pick a good password, don’t tell it to anyone, and make sure your system is free of viruses you will probably be safe.  More information about how we use state of the art encryption to keep your information safe can be found on the Security FAQ.  However, the Security FAQ is in no sense a legal document and should not be considered included as part of this agreement.</p>
