				<h2>Our Metrics</h2>
				<p>We ran a very small experiment, described <a href="experiment.html">here</a>.  The summary is that for 2 lunches and 3 dinners the app was active on 8 tables at a restaurant, and 8 people used it.  Assuming this sample is representative, that would imply around 50-70 uses a week per location if run all day everyday across a full sized restaurant.</p>

			<div id="cover">
				<h2>Cover Metrics</h2>
				<p>I called 10 restaurants listed on Cover's website.  Presumably the restaurants thought I was planning on eating there and just had a weird interest in the app.  I did not push whoever answered the phone hard to give specific numbers, and did not ask follow up questions if they misinterpreted my question about Cover's popularity.  This is because several people were already annoyed about being quizzed on the metrics of the app.</p>
				<p>The full data from those calls can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhAOsprY4zt5dEpQZi1DdVMxQWJ1NFF3TVg1dURrdlE#gid=0">here</a>.  In summary however:
					<ul>
					<li>3 said that they did not in fact accept Cover.  It is unclear why Cover has these restaurants listed on their website.</li>
					<li>2 had to ask their manager if they accepted the app, learned that they do, but were unable to provide any sort of number.</li>
					<li>1 use the app, but misheard the question about its popularity.</li>
					<li>3 said "a few" people had used it</li>
					<li>1 said that they get about "one a week"</li>
					</ul>
					I plan on collecting more data in the future, at which time I will update both this page and the Google Doc.</p>

				<h2>Tabbedout Metrics</h2>
				<p>I collected data on Tabbedout the same way I collected data on Cover.  I had extraordinary difficulty finding restaurants that actually use Tabbedout, however.  The majority of the ones listed on Tabbedout's website, when called, either had never heard of the app or stated that they did not use it.  A list of what happened when I called can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhAOsprY4zt5dEpQZi1DdVMxQWJ1NFF3TVg1dURrdlE#gid=1">here</a>.  In summary however:
					<ul>
					<li>1 restaurant had actually gone under</li>
					<li>1 said they no longer used the app</li>
					<li>2 said they don't use it <i>yet</i></li>
					<li>5 had never heard of the app and/or said they don't use it</li>
					<li>1 said they do use the app, though they (the person on the phone) personally hadn't seen anyone use it</li>
					</ul>
					From what I hear from insiders, the situation is pretty grim at Tabbedout.  These phone calls would seem to back up that idea, or at best point to a very out-of-date list on their website.  As with Cover, I will continue to collect more data.</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>Our experiment was small, and more data needs to be collected on Cover/Tabbedout.  All that said, our metrics appear to be around 50x Cover's, and from what I can tell Tabbedout is not in a better situation.  So our metrics look good, I'd say.</p>
